<ul>
<li>Move com.unity.test-framework to Unity source code - now it's an embedded package.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where retry or repeat would reset on domain reloads.</li>
<li>Added support for selecting different architectures on the MacOS and Windows platforms.</li>

<li>Added support for architecture for macOS anb Windows platforms.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the progress bar would be left visible, if the editor is restarted during a player run.</li>
<li>Any exception thrown during OneTimeTeardown will now correctly be flagged as happening during TearDown, rather than during Setup.</li>
<li>An total duration is now shown for each suite in the test runner UI, when selected. Note that this does not take into account OneTimeSetup and OneTimeTearDown durations.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where TestFinished was duplicated when running tests, containing domain reload.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue were parent node result was not updated after all tests under the node were finished.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added UnityOneTimeSetUp and UnityOneTimeTearDown attributes, allowing for setup and teardown with yields to be run only once for each test fixture.</li>
<li>Use a reduced player path when building a test player for GameCoreXboxSeries and GameCoreXboxOne platforms, avoiding a build error due to the path length in long project paths (DSTR-1060).</li>
<li>Fixed a regression where the &quot;Rerun failed tests&quot; button would not work correctly in the test runner UI.</li>
<li>ITestAction and IOuterUnityTestAction was not triggering correctly when defined on a fixture level, this is now fixed (UTF-582).</li>
<li>Improved test assembly build times in some cases by ensuring that the test runner utilizes the full editor update to construct the test tree (UTF-592).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing between EditMode and PlayMode would not update the search bar as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="145---2024-07-02">[1.4.5] - 2024-07-02</h2>
<ul>

<li>Changed to use a progress bar inside the test runner window when running tests. This ensures that the progress bar is not fighting to display when e.g. compiling scripts and also makes it easier to cancel a run. This progress bar is displayed for all types of runs (EditMode, PlayMode and Player). (UTF-596).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where ignored tests with an attributes did not display the ignore reason in the test runner UI.</li>
